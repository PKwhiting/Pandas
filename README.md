# Overview

At my first attempt of using python for data analysis, I tried to look at the historical  growth of the S&P 500 and compare it against high end fashion shoes during the same time period. As a shoe connoisseur, I was trying to see if it was more beneficial to invest in shoes or in the S&P 500 and which one had a higher payout. With being fairly familiar with excel, using Pandas for data analysis turned out to be quite a challenge. It was almost like learning a new language. But I was able to get the two data sets to overlay against each other on a table and get a correlation number and there wasnt any at all. Given that I was only looking at data from a two year period, I wasnt able to make a conclusion of any substance. If I was able to get my hands on data from the last 10 years perhaps, a real conclusion could be made.
